# What is this?

The **Roblox Studio Mod Manager** is an open-source alternative bootstrapper for Roblox Studio. It is intended for power users who want to make experimental changes/tweaks to Roblox Studio without those changes being overwritten, and experiment with development builds/features of Roblox Studio before the general public.

# Features
* File overrides are sustained between updates.
* Updates are applied incrementally to a single directory.
* Smooth transitions between development builds of Roblox Studio.
* A fast flag editor, allowing you to toggle new unstable features.
* Support for launching from the website, and from saved _RBXL_ files.
* File updates from Roblox's deployment servers are only applied where needed.
* Runs and installs in a separate directory, 100% independent of Roblox Studio's bootstrapper.
* An editor for adding and editing individual class icons of Roblox Studio's class-icon sprite sheet.

# ANTI-VIRUS DISCLAIMER

If you have an anti-virus program installed, there's a non-zero chance it may flag this program as malicious, due to this application being misdiagnosed as a trojan horse.<br/>

It was flagged as such because it downloads builds of Roblox Studio from a remote location and executes them on your PC. Since anti-virus programs can't distinguish whether this is malicious or not, it chooses to take no chances and assume it is malicious.<br/>

I've attempted to get this cleared several times, but haven't had any luck so far. I may need to get the application signed by a proper certificate authority, which will cost me some money to do.<br/>

In the meantime, you can try this workaround from boatbomber if you'd still like to use it:
